KOOG LIBRARY SETUP

To use Koog, you must have Racket version 5 installed. Get it from
http://www.racket-lang.org/ if you do not already have it installed.

Begin Koog installation by unpacking the tar file under some directory
that is on your PLTCOLLECTS path.

For example:

  mkdir $HOME/pltcollects
  cd $HOME/pltcollects
  tar xzvf /tmp/koog.tar.gz
  export $PLTCOLLECTS=$HOME/pltcollects:$PLTCOLLECTS

Now you should be able to do:

  racket --eval '(require koog/koog)'

KOOG COMMAND LINE TOOL SETUP

To run Koog from the command line, you can use the cli-shell.sh shell
script, on a suitably Unix-like system at least. To create a "koog"
executable, you might for instance:

  mkdir -p $(HOME)/bin
  ln -sf $HOME/pltcollects/koog/cli-shell.sh $(HOME)/bin/koog
  export PATH=$PATH:$(HOME)/bin

and now it should be possible to run

  koog --help

On Windows you may have to write a different executable that invokes
the 'main' function in the cli.rkt module.

EMACS INTEGRATION SETUP

To set up Koog for use within the Emacs editor, with the C++ language,
say, you might add something like the following to your ~/.emacs file:

  (setq load-path
        (nconc
         (list
          (concat (getenv "HOME") "/pltcollects/koog/emacs")
         )
         load-path))

  (require 'koog)

  (add-hook 'c++-mode-hook
            (lambda ()
              (define-key c++-mode-map [(control o) (m)]
                'koog-map-prefix)
              ))

Having done this, in the C++ mode you should be able to insert Koog
markers with the command C-o m i, and so forth. See the koog.el file
for more information.

For languages without C style comments you will want to customize some
of the variables defined by koog.el, probably in the mode "hook" in
order to make the customizations buffer local. For a TeX mode, for
example, you might specify

  (setq koog-comment-style "tex")
  (setq koog-open-marker "%***koog ")
  (setq koog-close-marker " %***\n%***end")

VIM INTEGRATION SETUP

To set up Koog for use within the Vim editor, you might add something
like the following to your ~/.vimrc file:

  if filereadable(expand("$HOME/pltcollects/koog/vim/koog.vimrc"))
    source $HOME/pltcollects/koog/vim/koog.vimrc
  endif

Having done this, you should be able to insert Koog markers with the
command m i, and so forth. See the koog.vimrc file for more
information.
